        <p>The Los Angeles School Police Department is meant to be dedicated to 
            providing security and policing within and around schools in the Los Angeles 
            Unified District. Yet, through the emergence of school violence school 
            administrators seek to filter problematic behaviors like truancy, loitering 
            and disrespect through historical methods of zero tolerance policies which 
            disproportionately affect students of color. I want to investigate the 
            relationship of how the presence of the Los Angeles School Police Department 
            (LASPD) contributes to the pre-established spatially disciplined atmosphere, 
            as seen through in-school suspensions and expulsions, of urban schools. 
            How does it change the way students feel about themselves and their emotional
             regulation?  In response to that exacerbation of violence, I want to explore 
             he studentsâ€™ reactions and observe how they might differ between students, 
             parents and educators.</p>
