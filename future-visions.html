        <h2>Advocacy for Eradication and Defunding of LASPD</h2>
        <p>Students, particularly those involved in grassroots advocacy, champion this perspective. They feel over-policed and advocate for reallocating funds from policing to educational resources. These students respond to their discomfort and the criminalization they perceive from the presence of police in schools, viewing it as counterproductive to creating a supportive learning environment.</p>

        <h2>Advocacy for Retaining or Increasing Police Presence</h2>
        <p>Many parents, including a significant number of Latino and Black parents, believe that having officers on campus enhances school safety. They are primarily concerned about external threats like mass shootings. However, they also recognize the potential negative impacts of police presence, suggesting a nuanced understanding of safety that balances protection with concerns of policing practices.</p>

        <h2>The Complexity of Viewpoints</h2>
        <p>The divergent perspectives, especially among Black and Latino parents, highlight the nuanced meaning of safety that balances protection with concerns of policing practices. These varying conceptualizations of safety engender a spectrum of solutions, ranging from holistic approaches that integrate mental and social well-being with physical safety, to those centered on physical security measures. This complexity reflects the broader debate, encompassing immediate safety concerns and considerations about the educational environment and the impact of policing on students' well-being and educational experience.</p>
